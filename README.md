# UFO-Sightings

## Overview
This project we provide information about UFO sightings using a static webpage. here users can filter data by date, city, state, and a characteristic of a sighting.

By using the folter table you can state the date, city, state and a characteristic of the sighting you are interested and the program will look for similar data, 
outputting the results in a table for better visualization.

* One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. 
* Increasing data available by using webscrapping of websites from the internet that record all this information for the public
